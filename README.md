# screenshotter
Quick and dirty screenshotter. Captures the content of one or more windows at a regular interval, and saves it as a jpg.

Click 'Add source' to add more windows.
Click 'Select window' for each source to select which window to capture.
Click 'Start recording' to save a .jpg screenshot of each window at the set interval (default 1000ms).
Location to store the screenshots can be set for each source (default is My documents).

NOTE:
To capture chrome windows (or other browsers), go to browser settings and disable hardware acceleration.
This code doesn't work for UWP apps (windows store applications and built in apps like calculator).
